**THE GAME: CATAN**

**INTRODUCTION**
Welcome to the unexplored island of Catan!
As you and your fellow explorers gaze across the uninhabited landscape of hexagonal tracts of terrain, you quickly realize that this unique land arrangement provides ample space for each of you to put down roots.

You race off to establish your respective communities by gathering resources from nearby terrain, building your infrastructure, and nurturing trade relationships. Watch out for surprises-- your rivals can block your path or send the robber to plunder your wealth!

Good luck, explorers!

If this is your first time playing CATAN, we recommend using the setup shown here. For additional variety, check out the Variable Setup described on page 11.

**1. Assemble the Frame**
Match the numbers at the puzzle piece ends of the sea frame pieces to assemble the coast of Catan.

**2. Place the Hexes and Number Discs**
Place the terrain hexes and number discs inside the frame as shown.

**3. Create the Supply**
Sort the resource cards by type and place them in five faceup stacks in the card trays. Shuffle the development cards and place them in a facedown stack in the empty card tray slot. Place the Longest Route and Largest Army tiles near the game board.

**4. Place the Robber and Player Pieces**
* Place the robber on the desert hex
* Each player selects a color and takes the roads and buildings (settlements and cities) in that color along with a player aid. In a 3-player game, do not use the white pieces.
* Place 2 starting settlements and roads for each player as shown.

**5. Collect Your Starting Resources**
Each player takes the resource cards from the supply that match the hexes adjacent to their second settlement, highlighted in black. Keep these cards hidden in your hand.

**6. Choose the First Player**
Each player rolls the dice. The player with the highest roll is the first player.

**TURN OVERVIEW**
CATAN is played over a series of turns, starting with the first player, and moving clockwise around the table. A turn consists of two phases, which occur in this order:
1. Production phase
2. Action phase
Once you have finished the Action phase, if you have not won, pass the dice to the player on your left. They begin their turn with the Production phase.

**PRODUCTION PHASE**
**PLAY A DEVELOPMENT CARD**
If you have development cards, you may play one of them before rolling the dice. See "Development Cards" on page 9.
**ROLL DICE**
Roll both dice and add them together. This total determines which hexes produce resources this turn.
**COLLECT RESOURCES**
Hexes with a number disc matching the dice roll produce this turn. Each player with a settlement on a producing hex receives 1 resource card of the corresponding type from the supply.

If a player has 2 or 3 settlements on that hex, they receive 1 resource card for each settlement.

Similarly, a player receives 2 resource cards for each of their cities on that hex.

If there are not enough resource cards in the supply to fulfill everyone's production, then no one receives any of that resource. However, if only one player is affected, give that player as many of those resource cards as remain in the supply.

* Forests produce wood
* Hills produce brick
* Pastures produce wool
* Mountains produce ore
* Fields produce wheat
* The desert produces nothing

**Example:**
The White player rolls an 8. Blue has a settlement on the mountain hex with the number 8 disc, so Blue receives 1 ore resource card. Orange receives 2 ore for their city on that hex.

**RESOLVE A 7**
When you roll a 7, hexes do not produce any resources. Instead:
**1. DISCARD RESOURCES**
Each player who has more than 7 resource cards must choose half (rounded down) of their resource cards and return them to the supply.

**Example:**
White has 9 resource cards in hand. When a 7 is rolled, they must discard 4 cards.

**2. ACTIVATE THE ROBBER**
You must move the robber to a new hex.

Steal 1 random resource card from a player who has a building on that hex. If multiple players have buildings on the new hex, you choose one player to rob.
**Important:**
A hex with the robber does not produce resources when its number is rolled.

**Example:**
Orange rolls a 7. They move the robber to the pasture hex with a red settlement and a blue city. Orange chooses to steal a card from Blue and takes a random card without looking.

**ACTION PHASE**
You may take actions in this phase as often as you like and in any order, as long as you have the resources to do so.

**TRADE**
You may trade freely with other players and the supply to get the resources you need to build. During your turn, other players may only trade with you, not with each other or with the supply.
There are three types of trades you may perform:

**TRADE WITH OTHER PLAYERS**
To trade with other players, announce which resource(s) you want and which resource(s) you are willing to trade. Other players may accept your proposal, make counteroffers, or make their own proposals.
**Important:**
You may not give away cards in any way, which includes trading matching resource cards (for example, trying to trade 3 ore for 1 ore is not allowed).
**Example:**
It is Blue™s turn, and they want 1 wheat. Orange will trade 1 wheat and wants 1 wool in return. Blue agrees and the players exchange cards. White also wants to trade for 1 wool, but Blue no longer has any. White may not trade with Orange because it is not Orange's turn.

**GENERAL TRADE WITH THE SUPPLY (4:1)**
To trade with the supply, put 4 of the same resource cards into the supply and take 1 card of a different resource from the supply.
**Example:**
It is Blue's turn. They choose to trade 4 wood for 1 ore.

**PORT TRADE WITH THE SUPPLY (3:1 OR 2:1)**
If you have a building on a 3:1 port, you may put 3 of the same resource cards into the supply and take 1 card of a different resource from the supply.

If you have a building on a 2:1 port, you may put 2 of the resource cards shown on the port into the supply and take 1 card of a different resource from the supply.

**Example:**
White wants 1 ore. On their turn, they may not trade 2 wheat for 1 ore because they do not have a building on the 2:1 wheat port. However, they may trade 3 wood for 1 ore because they have a settlement built on a 3:1 port.

**BUILD**
Roads, buildings (settlements and cities), and development cards each have different costs. During your turn, you may spend resources (aka "build") to place roads and buildings on the board, as well as to take development cards from the supply. To do so, simply return the required resource cards from your hand to the supply.

**ROADS**
Roads are worth 0 VP
Roads are placed on empty hex edges. A new road must connect to one of your existing roads or buildings. You may not build a road starting on the other side of an opponent's building.
Building cost: 1 wood, 1 brick

**Longest Route:** the first player to have 5 continuous roads in play receives this tile. If another player has more continuous roads in play, they immediately receive this tile. The Longest Route tile is worth 2 VPs.
If, when a player's route is broken, they no longer meet the requirements for the Longest Route, the tile is returned to the supply. It remains in the supply until a single player has the longest continuous route of at least 5 roads. That layer immediately receives the bonus tile and the 2 VPs.
**Example:**
Red has a continuous route of 7 roads and the Longest Route tile. White has a continuous route of 6 roads. On White™s turn, they build a settlement at the intersection shown, breaking Red™s route into a four-segment route and a three-segment route. Since White now has the longest route, they receive the tile and the 2 VPs.

**SETTLEMENTS**
Settlements are worth 1 VP.
Settlements are placed on empty intersections. A new settlement must follow the Distance Rule and must connect to at least one of your existing roads. You have 5 settlement pieces. To continue building more settlements, you must first upgrade one to a city.
Building cost: 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wool, 1 wheat

**The Distance Rule:**
When placing a settlement, stay at least two edges away from all other buildings!

**CITIES**
Cities are worth 2 VPs.

Cities always replace settlements. To build a city, remove one of your settlements from the board, return it to your player area, and place your city where the settlement was located. You have 4 cities and may not build more.
Building cost: 2 wheat, 3 ore

**DEVELOPMENT CARDS**
When you build a development card, draw the top card of the deck. Development cards stay hidden until used. They do not count toward the number of cards in your hand when a 7 is rolled, and the robber may not steal them.
You may play 1 development card during your turn by placing it face up in your player area. It may not be a card you built this turn. You may play a development card before rolling dice or at any time during the Action phase.
Development cards never go back into the supply. If the supply runs out, you may not build any more cards.
You may not trade or give away development cards.
Building cost: 1 wheat, 1 wool, 1 ore

**Types of development cards:**
**INVENTION**
When you play this card, take any 2 resource cards from the supply. Add them to your hand. They may be 2 of the same resource of 2 different resources.

**MONOPOLY**
When you play this card, announce one type of resource. Each player must give you all their resource cards of that type. You may only request one type of resource when you play this card, regardless of how many cards you receive.

**ROAD BUILDING**
When you play this card, build 2 roads at no cost (i.e. without spending any resource cards).

**VICTORY POINT**
Reveal all your Victory Point cards, including any built this turn, if you can reach the number of VPs needed to win. Otherwise, you must keep Victory Point cards hidden in your player area.

**KNIGHT**
Move the robber to a new hex. Steal 1 random resource card from a player with a building on that hex.

**Largest Army:** The first player to have 3 Knight cards in play receives this tile.
If another player has more Knight cards in play, they immediately receive this tile.
The Largest Army tile is worth 2 VPs.

**WINNING THE GAME**
If you have 10 or more VPs at any point during your turn, the game ends immediately and you are the winner!
Turn over any number of Victory Point cards, including ones built this turn, to show that you have reached 10 VPs.

Congratulations!
**Example:**
Blue ends the game on their turn with 10 VPs (2 cities, 3 settlements, the Longest Route tile, and 1 Victory Point card). Victory!
