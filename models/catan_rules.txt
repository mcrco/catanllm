Constructing The Island

The frame pieces hold the board together and prevent the pieces from moving after the board is in place. Before building the island, assemble the frame by matching the numbers at the ends of the frame pieces together (i.e., 1-1, 2-2, etc.).

You can then construct the island of Catan using the 19 terrain hexes as shown on page 3.

Starting Set-up for Beginners

You can play the game Catan on a variable game board. For your first game, however, we suggest that you use the "Starting Set-up for Beginners ®." (See Illus. A on page 3.) This set-up is well-balanced for all players.

Before your first game, you must remove the die-cut components from the cardboard holders. Carefully punch out and separate the pieces. When punching tiles out of the die-cut sheets, always push the tiles through from the front, "cut" side (pushing from the back may cause the tiles to rip).

Lay out the map as specified in Illustration A (or on the back of this booklet).

First, assemble the frame as shown. Second, create Catan by placing the 19 terrain hexes on the table-again as shown. Third, place the circular number tokens on top of the designated terrain hexes. Finally, place your settlements and roads.

Starting Set-up for Experienced Players

It is more fun to play with a variable game board-with the game board laid out randomly. The board changes each game. If you would like to use the variable set-up, you can find the guidelines in the Almanac under Set-up, Variable . Also look for useful tips under Set-up Phase and Tactics

Setting Up the Game

Select a color and take your 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads (no more and no less!). Place your 2 roads and your 2 settlements on the game board. Place your remaining settlements, roads, and cities down in front of you.
Note: If you are playing a 3-player game, nobody plays the red position indicated on the starting map.
Take your color's building costs card. (See Illustration B.)

Place the special cards "Longest Road" and "Largest Army" beside the game board along with the 2 dice.
Sort the resource cards into 5 stacks and put them face up next to the game board. Shuffle the development cards and place them face down by the board.
You receive resources for each terrain hex around your starting settlement marked with a white star (see Illustration A). Take the appropriate resource cards from their stacks.

Example: See Illustration A. Blue receives 1 brick card, 1 lumber card, and 1 ore card for his leftmost settlement (i.e., his settlement marked with a star).

Each player keeps their resource cards hidden in their hand.
Important: Settlements and cities may only be placed at the corners of the terrain bexes-never along the edges (see Illustration C). Roads may only be placed at the edges of the terrain bexes-1 road per edge (see Illustration D). The Distance Rule means many intersections along roads will remain unoccupied.

Turn Overview

Unless you're using the Starting Set-Up for Experienced Players, the oldest player goes first. On your turn, you can do the following in the order listed:

- You must roll for resource production (the result applies to all players).
- You may trade resource cards with other players and/or use maritime trade
- You may build roads , settlements or cities and/ or buy development cards . You may also play one development card at any time during your turn.
After you're done, pass the dice to the player to your left, who then continues the game with step 1.
Tip: For advanced players, we recommend combining the second and third steps. You can find more details in the Almanac under "Combined Trade/Build Phase ".

The Turn in Detail

1. Resource Production

You begin your turn by rolling both dice. The sum of the dice determines which terrain hexes produce resources.

Each player who has a settlement on an intersection that borders a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives 1 resource card of the hex's type. For an example see resource production . If you have 2 or 3 settlements bordering that hex, you receive 1 resource card for each settlement. You receive 2 resource cards for each city you own that borders that hex. If there are not enough of a given resource in the supply to fulfill everyone's production, then no one receives any of that resource during that turn (unless it only affects 1 player).

2. Trade

Afterwards, you may trade freely (using either or both types of trades below) to gain needed resource cards:

a) Domestic Trade

On your turn, you can trade resource cards with any of the other players. You can announce which resources you need and what you are willing to trade for them. The other players can also make their own proposals and counteroffers.
Important: Players may only trade with the player whose turn it is. The other players may not trade among themselves.

b) Maritime Trade

You can also trade without the other players! During your turn, you can always trade at 4:1 by putting 4 identical resource cards back in their stack and taking any 1 resource card of your choice for it. If you have a settlement or city on a harbor, you can trade with the bank more favorably: at either a 3:1 ratio or, in certain harbors, at 2:1 (trading the resource type shown).
Important: The 4:1 trade is always possible, even if you do not have a settlement on a harbor.

3. Build

Now you can build. Through building, you can increase your victory points, expand your road network, improve your resource production, and/or buy useful development cards. To build, you must pay specific combinations of resource cards (see the Building Costs Card ). Take the appropriate number of roads, settlements, and/or cities from your supply and place them on the game board. Keep development cards hidden in your hand.
You cannot build more pieces than what is available in your pool—a maximum of 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads.

a) Road Requires: Brick & Lumber

A new road must always connect to 1 of your existing roads, settlements, or cities. Only 1 road can be built on any given path.
The first player to build a continuous road (not counting forks) of at least 5 road segments receives the special card "Longest Road." If another player
succeeds in building a longer road than the one created by the current owner of the "Longest Road" card, they immediately take the special card (and its 2 victory points). Tip: This creates a 4 victory point swing!

b) Settlement Requires: Brick, Lumber, Wool, & Grain

Take special note of the "Distance Rule" : you may only build a settlement at an intersection if all 3 of the adjacent intersections are vacant (i.e., none are occupied by any settlements or cities-even yours).

Each of your settlements must connect to at least 1 of your own roads. Regardless of whose turn it is (i.e., during any production phase), when a terrain hex produces resources, you receive 1 resource card for each settlement you have adjacent to that terrain hex.

Each settlement is worth 1 victory point.

c) City Requires: 3 Ore & 2 Grain

You may only establish a city by upgrading one of your settlements.

When you upgrade a settlement to a city, put the settlement (house) piece back in your supply and replace it with a city piece (church).
Gties produce twice as many resources as settlements. You acquire 2 resource cards for an adjacent terrain hex that produces resources.

Each city is worth 2 victory points.

d) Buying a Development Card Requires: Ore, Wool, & Grain

When you buy a development card, draw the top card from the deck. There are 3 different kinds of these cards: knight *, progress •, and victory point *. Each has a different effect (see 4.b, below).

Development cards never go back into the supply, and you cannot buy development cards if the supply is empty.

Keep your development cards hidden (in your hand) until you use them, so your opponents can't anticipate your play.

4. Special Cases

a) Rolling a " 7 " and Activating the Robber

If you roll a " 7 ," no one receives any resources.
Instead, every player who has more than 7 resource cards must select half (rounded down) of their resource cards and return them to the bank.

Then you must move the robber *. Proceed as follows:
(1) You must move the robber immediately to the number token of any other terrain hex or to the desert • hex.
(2) Then you steal 1 (random) resource card from an opponent who has a settlement or city adjacent to the target terrain hex. The player who is robbed holds their resource cards face down. You then take 1 card at random. If the target hex is adjacent to 2 or more players' settlements or cities, you choose which one you want to steal from.
Important: If the production number for the hex containing the robber is rolled, the owners of adjacent settlements and cities do not receive resources. The robber prevents it.

b) Playing Development Cards

At any time during your turn, you may play 1 development card (put it face up on the table). That card, however, may not be a card you bought during the same turn (except for a victory point card, as described below)!

Knight Cards (Purple Frame)

If you play a knight card, you must immediately move the robber. See "Rolling a ' 7 ' and Activating the Robber" above and follow steps 1 and 2.

Once played, knight cards remain face up in front of you. The first player to have 3 knight cards in front of themself receives the special card "Largest Army," which is worth 2 victory points. If another player has more knight cards in front of them than the current holder of the Largest Army card, they immediately take the special card and its 2 victory points.

Progress Cards (Green Frame)

If you play a progress card, follow its instructions. Then the card is removed from the game (i.e., toss it in the box).

Victory Point Cards (Orange Frame)

You must keep victory point cards hidden. You may only reveal them during your turn and when you are sure that you have 10 victory points-that is, to win the game. Of course, you can reveal them after the end of the game if someone else wins. You may play any number of victory point cards during your turn, even during the turn you purchase them.

Ending the Game

If you have 10 or more victory points during your turn, the game ends and you are the winner! If you reach 10 points when it is not your turn, the game continues until any player (including you) has 10 points on their turn.
