LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's turn 3, and I (RED) have no victory points or resources. The robber is on a desert tile, which isn't immediately impacting anyone. My primary goal is to establish a resource base and start accumulating victory points.

Looking at the board, node 2 is adjacent to Wood (9) and Wheat (5), and node 3 is adjacent to Brick (4) and Wheat (5). Node 4 is adjacent to Brick (4) and Wood (5). Node 5 is adjacent to Wood (5) and Wheat (8). Node 6 is adjacent to Sheep (3) and Brick (11).

Given the limited information and the need to get started, I'll prioritize a location with diverse resource potential. Node 3 seems good because it provides Brick and Wheat, which are crucial for building roads and settlements.

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Red, and I have no resources. My settlement is on node 3, which has access to Brick and Wood (4s). Building a road is the only viable option right now, as I can't build a settlement or city without resources, and development cards are not a good option with no resources.

Action 0 (2 ↔ 3) connects to a node with Wood (9) and Wheat (5). This is a decent option, potentially opening up future settlement spots.
Action 1 (3 ↔ 4) connects to a node with Wood (5) and Ore (10). This is also a good option, potentially opening up future settlement spots.
Action 2 (3 ↔ 12) connects to a node with Sheep (6) and Ore (4). This is a good option, potentially opening up future settlement spots.

Considering the robber is on (-2, 1, 1), blocking the 6 sheep, and the fact that I need to diversify my resource income, I will choose to build a road towards the ore.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Red, and I need to start building towards victory points. Currently, I have one settlement. I need to expand and secure good resource production. Looking at the board, node 10 is adjacent to a Wheat (9) and a Wood (3). Node 11 is adjacent to a Wood (3) and a Sheep (6). Node 13 is adjacent to an Ore (4) and a Sheep (6). Node 17 is adjacent to an Ore (10) and a Sheep (12).

Considering the robber is on the desert tile (-2, 1, 1), and the numbers rolled so far are likely to be somewhat random, diversifying resources is important. Node 10 seems like a good starting point as it gives access to Wheat and Wood, which are useful for building.

LLM OUTPUT:
I have 1 wood and 2 ore. Building a road costs 1 brick and 1 wood. I don't have any brick, so I cannot build a road. I need to focus on getting more resources to build settlements and cities. Since I have ore, I should consider building a city when I get the wheat. However, I can't do that now. I need to wait for my next roll to get resources. Since I can't take any action, I will pass. However, since I must choose an action, I will choose the one that requires the least resources, even though I don't have them. This will at least show intent to expand.

LLM OUTPUT:
I have 1 wood and 2 ore. Building a road costs 1 brick and 1 wood. I don't have any brick, so I cannot build a road. I need to focus on getting more resources to build settlements and cities. Since I have ore, I should consider building a city when I get the wheat. However, I can't do that now. I need to wait for my next roll to get resources. Since I can't take any action, I will pass. However, since I must choose an action, I will choose the one that requires the least resources, even though I don't have them. This will at least show intent to expand.

LLM OUTPUT:
I have 10 resources: 2 Wood, 3 Brick, 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, and 5 Ore. I need to get to 10 victory points. Currently, I have 2 VP. Building a settlement would give me 1 VP, and a city would give me 2 VP. I have enough resources to build a road (1 Brick, 1 Wood) or a settlement (1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep). I don't have Wheat or Sheep, so I can't build a settlement right now. 

I have a lot of Ore. I can trade 4 Ore for any other resource at the bank. I need Wheat or Sheep to build a settlement. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat seems like the best option to enable building a settlement on my next turn.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I have 7 resources: 2 Wood, 3 Brick, 1 Sheep, and 1 Ore. I need to expand to get to 10 victory points. Building a road is the most efficient use of my resources right now. I want to extend my network and potentially block opponents. Building a road from node 17 to 39 seems good as it extends my existing settlement at 18 and could open up future settlement locations.

2025-06-07 02:18:25,317 - 
LLM OUTPUT:
I need to prioritize building settlements or cities to gain victory points. However, I lack the resources for either right now. Extending my road network is the next best option, as it can lead to future settlement locations and potentially the longest road.

Looking at the available road options, building a road connecting nodes 17 and 39 seems strategically sound. It extends my network towards potentially valuable areas and doesn't immediately benefit opponents. It also doesn't block anyone.

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to prioritize building settlements or cities to gain victory points. However, I lack the resources for either right now. Extending my road network is the next best option, as it can lead to future settlement locations and potentially the longest road.

Looking at the available road options, building a road connecting nodes 17 and 39 seems strategically sound. It extends my network towards potentially valuable areas and doesn't immediately benefit opponents. It also doesn't block anyone.

- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to prioritize building settlements or cities to gain victory points. However, I lack the resources for either right now. Extending my road network is the next best option, as it can lead to future settlement locations and potentially the longest road.

Looking at the available road options, building a road connecting nodes 17 and 39 seems strategically sound. It extends my network towards potentially valuable areas and doesn't immediately benefit opponents. It also doesn't block anyone.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to prioritize building settlements or cities to gain victory points. However, I lack the resources for either right now. Extending my road network is the next best option, as it can lead to future settlement locations and potentially the longest road.

Looking at the available road options, building a road connecting nodes 17 and 39 seems strategically sound. It extends my network towards potentially valuable areas and doesn't immediately benefit opponents. It also doesn't block anyone.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to prioritize building settlements or cities to gain victory points. However, I lack the resources for either right now. Extending my road network is the next best option, as it can lead to future settlement locations and potentially the longest road.

Looking at the available road options, building a road connecting nodes 17 and 39 seems strategically sound. It extends my network towards potentially valuable areas and doesn't immediately benefit opponents. It also doesn't block anyone.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to prioritize building settlements or cities to gain victory points. However, I lack the resources for either right now. Extending my road network is the next best option, as it can lead to future settlement locations and potentially the longest road.

Looking at the available road options, building a road connecting nodes 17 and 39 seems strategically sound. It extends my network towards potentially valuable areas and doesn't immediately benefit opponents. It also doesn't block anyone.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I have 7 resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, and 4 Ore. I need to get to 10 victory points. Building a settlement costs 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 1 Sheep. I am missing Wheat. Building a city costs 3 Ore and 2 Wheat. I am missing Wheat. I can trade 4 Ore for 1 Wheat at a 4:1 bank trade. This will allow me to build a settlement. I should prioritize building settlements to gain victory points.

I have 4 Ore and no Wheat, Brick, Wood, or Sheep. I need to build to get to 10 VP. Building a settlement costs 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 1 Sheep. Building a city costs 3 Ore and 2 Wheat. I can't build either with my current resources. The only option is to trade. I need Wheat to build a settlement or city. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat is the best option to get closer to building.

LLM OUTPUT:
I have 4 Ore and no Wheat, Brick, Wood, or Sheep. I need to build to get to 10 VP. Building a settlement costs 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 1 Sheep. Building a city costs 3 Ore and 2 Wheat. I can't build either with my current resources. The only option is to trade. I need Wheat to build a settlement or city. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat is the best option to get closer to building.

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I have 4 Ore and no Wheat, Brick, Wood, or Sheep. I need to build to get to 10 VP. Building a settlement costs 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 1 Sheep. Building a city costs 3 Ore and 2 Wheat. I can't build either with my current resources. The only option is to trade. I need Wheat to build a settlement or city. Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat is the best option to get closer to building.

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, and 1 Sheep. My goal is to get to 10 victory points. I currently have 2, so I need 8 more. Building settlements/cities is the most direct path. 

Looking at the board, I want to expand and potentially block opponents. Node 10 is a good option as it's adjacent to a 9 Wood and a 5 Wheat. Building a road to node 10 (action 1) would allow me to potentially build a settlement there on my next turn if I get the necessary resources (Wheat and Sheep). This would give me a good position for future expansion and resource gathering.

Other options are less appealing. Building roads to nodes already somewhat blocked or not strategically advantageous.

Therefore, I choose to build a road to node 10.

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, and 1 Sheep. My goal is to get to 10 victory points. I currently have 2, so I need 8 more. Building settlements/cities is the most direct path. 

Looking at the board, I want to expand and potentially block opponents. Node 10 is a good option as it's adjacent to a 9 Wood and a 5 Wheat. Building a road to node 10 (action 1) would allow me to potentially build a settlement there on my next turn if I get the necessary resources (Wheat and Sheep). This would give me a good position for future expansion and resource gathering.

Other options are less appealing. Building roads to nodes already somewhat blocked or not strategically advantageous.

Therefore, I choose to build a road to node 10.

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, and 1 Sheep. My goal is to get to 10 victory points. I currently have 2, so I need 8 more. Building settlements/cities is the most direct path. 

Looking at the board, I want to expand and potentially block opponents. Node 10 is a good option as it's adjacent to a 9 Wood and a 5 Wheat. Building a road to node 10 (action 1) would allow me to potentially build a settlement there on my next turn if I get the necessary resources (Wheat and Sheep). This would give me a good position for future expansion and resource gathering.

Other options are less appealing. Building roads to nodes already somewhat blocked or not strategically advantageous.

Therefore, I choose to build a road to node 10.

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, and 1 Sheep. My goal is to get to 10 victory points. I currently have 2, so I need 8 more. Building settlements/cities is the most direct path. 

Looking at the board, I want to expand and potentially block opponents. Node 10 is a good option as it's adjacent to a 9 Wood and a 5 Wheat. Building a road to node 10 (action 1) would allow me to potentially build a settlement there on my next turn if I get the necessary resources (Wheat and Sheep). This would give me a good position for future expansion and resource gathering.

Other options are less appealing. Building roads to nodes already somewhat blocked or not strategically advantageous.

Therefore, I choose to build a road to node 10.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, and 1 Sheep. My goal is to get to 10 victory points. I currently have 2, so I need 8 more. Building settlements/cities is the most direct path. 

Looking at the board, I want to expand and potentially block opponents. Node 10 is a good option as it's adjacent to a 9 Wood and a 5 Wheat. Building a road to node 10 (action 1) would allow me to potentially build a settlement there on my next turn if I get the necessary resources (Wheat and Sheep). This would give me a good position for future expansion and resource gathering.

Other options are less appealing. Building roads to nodes already somewhat blocked or not strategically advantageous.

Therefore, I choose to build a road to node 10.

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
Okay, let's analyze the situation. I have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, and 1 Sheep. My goal is to get to 10 victory points. I currently have 2, so I need 8 more. Building settlements/cities is the most direct path. 

Looking at the board, I want to expand and potentially block opponents. Node 10 is a good option as it's adjacent to a 9 Wood and a 5 Wheat. Building a road to node 10 (action 1) would allow me to potentially build a settlement there on my next turn if I get the necessary resources (Wheat and Sheep). This would give me a good position for future expansion and resource gathering.

Other options are less appealing. Building roads to nodes already somewhat blocked or not strategically advantageous.

Therefore, I choose to build a road to node 10.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

2025-06-07 02:18:42,652 - 
LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that isn't an available action. Given my resources (1 Wood, 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 1 Ore), and the goal of reaching 10 victory points, building a road is the most sensible immediate action. Extending my road network can help me claim more favorable settlement locations and potentially achieve the Longest Road bonus. Action 1, building a road connecting nodes 1 and 2, is a good choice as it extends my existing road network and doesn't require any resources I don't have.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

2025-06-07 02:18:42,653 - 
LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that isn't an available action. Given my resources (1 Wood, 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 1 Ore), and the goal of reaching 10 victory points, building a road is the most sensible immediate action. Extending my road network can help me claim more favorable settlement locations and potentially achieve the Longest Road bonus. Action 1, building a road connecting nodes 1 and 2, is a good choice as it extends my existing road network and doesn't require any resources I don't have.

- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that isn't an available action. Given my resources (1 Wood, 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 1 Ore), and the goal of reaching 10 victory points, building a road is the most sensible immediate action. Extending my road network can help me claim more favorable settlement locations and potentially achieve the Longest Road bonus. Action 1, building a road connecting nodes 1 and 2, is a good choice as it extends my existing road network and doesn't require any resources I don't have.

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that is not an available action. I have 2 wood, 1 brick, and 1 ore. Building a road is the only viable option with my current resources. I want to expand my network and potentially block opponents. Building a road connecting nodes 3 and 4 seems reasonable, as it extends my existing road network and could open up future settlement opportunities.

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that is not an available action. I have 2 wood, 1 brick, and 1 ore. Building a road is the only viable option with my current resources. I want to expand my network and potentially block opponents. Building a road connecting nodes 3 and 4 seems reasonable, as it extends my existing road network and could open up future settlement opportunities.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that is not an available action. I have 2 wood, 1 brick, and 1 ore. Building a road is the only viable option with my current resources. I want to expand my network and potentially block opponents. Building a road connecting nodes 3 and 4 seems reasonable, as it extends my existing road network and could open up future settlement opportunities.

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that is not an available action. I have 2 wood, 1 brick, and 1 ore. Building a road is the only viable option with my current resources. I want to expand my network and potentially block opponents. Building a road connecting nodes 3 and 4 seems reasonable, as it extends my existing road network and could open up future settlement opportunities.

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

LLM OUTPUT:
I need to move the robber first, but that is not an available action. I have 2 wood, 1 brick, and 1 ore. Building a road is the only viable option with my current resources. I want to expand my network and potentially block opponents. Building a road connecting nodes 3 and 4 seems reasonable, as it extends my existing road network and could open up future settlement opportunities.

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean
