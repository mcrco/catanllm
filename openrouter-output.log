=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean

=== BOARD COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLANATION ===
SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS:
- Tiles: Identified by cube coordinates (x,y,z) where x+y+z=0
- Nodes: Intersection points between tiles, identified by integer IDs (0-53)
- Edges/Roads: Connections between two nodes, represented as (node_id1, node_id2)
- Each tile has 6 nodes at its corners and 6 edges connecting those nodes
- Adjacent tiles share nodes and edges
- Ports are located on specific edges facing the ocean
