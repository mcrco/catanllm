Stealing from BLUE here is a good option as Ore is a valuable resource.\n- Tile (1, -1, 0) (Brick 5): BLUE has a settlement at node 1, which is adjacent to this tile.

I should use this to get closer to building a settlement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the trades in terms of getting closer to a settlement (1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat):\nCurrent: 0 Wood, 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 4 Ore\n\nAction 1 (Trade 4 Ore for 1 Wheat):\nResources after trade: 0 Wood, 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 0 Ore.\nStill need: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep.\n\nAction 2 (Trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep):\nResources after trade: 0 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 0 Ore.\nStill need: 1 Wood. This is the closest to a settlement.\n\nAction 3 (Trade 4 Ore for 1 Brick):\nResources after trade: 0 Wood, 3 Brick, 0 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 0 Ore.\nStill need: 1 Wood, 1 Sheep.\n\nAction 4 (Trade 4 Ore for 1 Wood):\nResources after trade: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 0 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 0 Ore.\nStill need: 1 Sheep. This is also very close to a settlement.\n\nBoth Action 2 and Action 4 get me to needing only one more resource for a settlement.\nIf I trade for Sheep (Action 2), I will have 1 Sheep, 2 Brick, 1 Wheat. I would then need Wood.\nIf I trade for Wood (Action 4), I will have 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Wheat. I would then need Sheep.\n\nGiven my current production, I have a good chance of getting more Ore, Brick, Wheat, and Sheep. Wood (10) is on one of my settlements, so I have a decent chance of getting Wood. Sheep (6) is also on one of my settlements, so I have a good chance of getting Sheep.\n\nSince I have 2 Brick, I could also consider building a road if I get Wood. However, my priority is settlements for VP.\n\nLet's consider the next roll. If a 6 or 10 rolls, I get Sheep or Wood. If a 9 rolls, I get Ore, which I can then trade again.\n\nI have 4 Ore. I can trade it for either Wood or Sheep. Both get me to needing one more resource for a settlement.\nI will trade for Sheep. This leaves me with 1 Sheep, 2 Brick, 1 Wheat. I will then need Wood. I have a settlement on a Wood 10, so I have a good chance of getting it next turn.\n", "notes": "Trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep to get closer to building a settlement.", "response": "Trade 4 Ore for 1 Sheep to get closer to building a settlement.\n2", "actions": "=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n0: End turn\n1: Maritime trade: give 4 ORE for 1 WHEAT (4:1 port trade)\n2: Maritime trade: give 4 ORE for 1 SHEEP (4:1 port trade)\n3: Maritime trade: give 4 ORE for 1 BRICK (4:1 port trade)\n4: Maritime trade: give 4 ORE for 1 WOOD (4:1 port trade)", "game_state": "=== CATAN GAME STATE ===\nTurn: 26\nCurrent player: RED\n\n=== PLAYER STATUS ===\n>>> RED: 2 VP, 7 resources (Wood: 0, Brick: 2, Sheep: 0, Wheat: 1, Ore: 4), 0 dev cards\n    BLUE: 4 VP, 2 resources, 0 dev cards\n\n=== BOARD LAYOUT ===\nRobber position: (0, -1, 1)\n\n--- HEXAGON TILES ---\nTile 3: WOOD with number 10\nTile 4: DESERT (no resources)\nTile 2: SHEEP with number 6\nTile 0: ORE with number 9\nTile 5: WHEAT with number 3\nTile 1: BRICK with number 5\nTile 6: WHEAT with number 4\n\n--- PORTS ---\n\n--- ROADS (Edge Connections) ---\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 1\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 20\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 1 \u2194 2\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 2 \u2194 3\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 3 \u2194 12\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 7 \u2194 8\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 9 \u2194 10\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 12 \u2194 13\n\n--- POSSIBLE BUILDING LOCATIONS ---\nAvailable nodes for settlements: 19 nodes\nEmpty nodes: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23]\nAvailable road connections: 34 possible roads\n\n=== BUILDINGS SUMMARY ===\nRED: 2 settlements at nodes [3, 7], 0 cities, 10 roads\nBLUE: 2 settlements at nodes [9, 20], 1 cities at nodes [1], 6 roads\n\n\nPrevious moves: Prioritize high-probability resource production (6, 8, 5, 9, 10) and resource diversity for early game development.

I have enough resources to build a settlement.\n\nLet's analyze the available settlement location:\n- **Node 13**: This node is adjacent to Tile 3 (Wood 10), Tile 10 (Wood 10), and Tile 11 (Wood 10). This is a very wood-heavy location, which is not ideal for resource diversity, but it is a good production number. However, I already have a settlement at node 3, which is adjacent to Tile 3 (Wood 10).

This would give me access to Ore 9, which is a good resource.\n- **Action 3: Build road connecting nodes 11 \u2194 12**: This road would extend from my current road network towards node 11. Node 11 is adjacent to Tile 2 (Sheep 6), Tile 9 (Ore 9), and Tile 10 (Wood 10). This is a very good location for a future settlement, offering Sheep, Ore, and Wood.\n- **Action 4: Build road connecting nodes 2 \u2194 9**: This road would extend from my current road network towards node 9. Node 9 is adjacent to Tile 1 (Brick 5), Tile 2 (Sheep 6), and Tile 8 (Ore 9). This is also a very good location for a future settlement, offering Brick, Sheep, and Ore.\n- **Action 5: Build road connecting nodes 6 \u2194 7**: This road would extend from my current settlement at node 7 towards node 6.

BLUE has a city at node 1, which is adjacent to this tile. This would block BLUE's Brick production and potentially allow me to steal a Brick.

No one has a settlement or city adjacent to this tile.

Moving the robber here does nothing.\n\n*   **Action 4: Move robber to tile (0, 1, -1) (Wheat 3), steal from Color.BLUE.**\n    *   Tile (0, 1, -1) is a Wheat 3 tile.

I need Wood, Sheep, and Wheat for a settlement. I need more Ore and Wheat for a city.\n\nBlocking BLUE's production is important, especially since they are ahead in VPs.\nBlocking a high-probability number (like 9, 5, 4, 3) is good.\n\n*   **Ore 9 (Action 0):** BLUE has a city on node 1 (Ore 9, Brick 5, Wheat 4) and a settlement on node 9 (Sheep 6, Ore 9, Brick 5). Blocking Ore 9 would significantly impact BLUE's Ore income. Stealing Ore would be good for me to save up for a city.\n*   **Brick 5 (Action 1):** BLUE has a city on node 1 (Ore 9, Brick 5, Wheat 4) and a settlement on node 9 (Sheep 6, Ore 9, Brick 5). Blocking Brick 5 would also impact BLUE. I already have 2 Brick, so stealing Brick might not be my top priority, but it's still useful.\n*   **Wheat 3 (Action 4):** BLUE has a settlement on node 20 (Wheat 3, Wheat 4, Ore 9). Blocking Wheat 3 would impact BLUE's Wheat income. Stealing Wheat would be very useful for me for a settlement or city.\n*   **Wheat 4 (Action 5):** BLUE has a city on node 1 (Ore 9, Brick 5, Wheat 4) and a settlement on node 20 (Wheat 3, Wheat 4, Ore 9). Blocking Wheat 4 would significantly impact BLUE's Wheat income, especially from the city. Stealing Wheat would be very useful for me.\n\nComparing Wheat 3 (Action 4) and Wheat 4 (Action 5):\nWheat 4 is produced by a city (node 1) and a settlement (node 20). Blocking Wheat 4 would reduce BLUE's income by 3 (2 from city, 1 from settlement).\nWheat 3 is produced by a settlement (node 20). Blocking Wheat 3 would reduce BLUE's income by 1.\nTherefore, blocking Wheat 4 (Action 5) is more impactful in terms of reducing BLUE's resource generation. Stealing Wheat is also a high priority for me.\n\nComparing Ore 9 (Action 0) and Wheat 4 (Action 5):\nBoth are excellent choices. Ore 9 is produced by a city and a settlement for BLUE. Wheat 4 is produced by a city and a settlement for BLUE.\nMy current resources are 2 Brick, 1 Ore. I need Wheat for a settlement or city. I need more Ore for a city.\nStealing Wheat would help me get closer to a settlement. Stealing Ore would help me get closer to a city.\nGiven that I have 2 Brick and 1 Ore, getting Wheat seems more immediate for a settlement.\n\nHowever, BLUE has 7 resources. If I block a resource they are producing heavily, I have a higher chance of stealing that resource.\nBLUE's city on node 1 produces Ore 9, Brick 5, and Wheat 4.\nBLUE's settlement on node 9 produces Sheep 6, Ore 9, and Brick 5.\nBLUE's settlement on node 20 produces Wheat 3, Wheat 4, and Ore 9.\n\nBLUE is heavily invested in Ore, Brick, and Wheat.\nBlocking Wheat 4 (Action 5) seems like the most impactful move.

Assuming no_think:\nI have 3 VP and 8 resources (1 Wood, 2 Brick, 3 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore). BLUE has 7 VP. My goal is to reach 10 VP. I need to focus on increasing my VP count, either through settlements/cities or development cards. I currently have no Wheat, which is a problem for building settlements.\n\nLooking at my resources, I have enough for a road (1 Wood, 1 Brick). I do not have enough for a settlement (1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat) or a city (3 Ore, 2 Wheat). I also don't have enough for a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore).\n\nMy current settlements are at nodes 3, 7, and 13.\nNode 3: Ore (9), Sheep (6), Wood (10)\nNode 7: Brick (5), Ore (9), Wheat (4)\nNode 13: Wood (10), Ore (9), Sheep (6)\n\nI have roads connecting:\n1-2 (RED)\n2-3 (RED)\n2-9 (RED)\n3-12 (RED)\n6-7 (RED)\n6-23 (RED)\n7-8 (RED)\n12-13 (RED)\n\nBLUE has cities at nodes 1 and 9. This means they are producing heavily from those locations.\n\nLet's analyze the available road building options:\n\n1: Build road connecting nodes 13 \u2194 14.\n   - Node 13 is my settlement. Node 14 is adjacent to Wood (10), Sheep (6), and Desert. This road would extend my reach from my existing settlement. Node 14 is a potential settlement spot, but it's not ideal due to the Desert. However, it does connect to a Wood 10 and Sheep 6.\n\n2: Build road connecting nodes 3 \u2194 4.\n   - Node 3 is my settlement. Node 4 is adjacent to Desert, Wood (10), and Wheat (3). This road would extend my reach from my existing settlement. Node 4 is not a good settlement spot due to the Desert.\n\n3: Build road connecting nodes 22 \u2194 23.\n   - Node 23 is where I have a road ending. Node 22 is adjacent to Wheat (4), Ore (9), and Wheat (3). This is a very strong potential settlement spot (Node 22) as it gives me two Wheat tiles and an Ore tile. This would address my Wheat shortage and give me access to more Ore. This is a very attractive option.\n\n4: Build road connecting nodes 11 \u2194 12.\n   - Node 12 is where I have a road ending. Node 11 is a BLUE settlement. This road would connect my road to a BLUE settlement, which is not useful for my expansion.\n\n5: Build road connecting nodes 8 \u2194 9.\n   - Node 8 is where I have a road ending. Node 9 is a BLUE city. This road would connect my road to a BLUE city, which is not useful for my expansion.\n\n6: Build road connecting nodes 1 \u2194 6.\n   - Node 1 is a BLUE city. Node 6 is where I have a road ending. This road would connect my road to a BLUE city, which is not useful for my expansion.\n\nComparing the options, building a road towards node 22 (Action 3) is the most strategic. It leads to a strong potential settlement location with two Wheat tiles (4 and 3) and an Ore tile (9). This would significantly improve my resource production, especially Wheat, which I desperately need for settlements and development cards. While the 3 Wheat is not ideal, the 4 Wheat and 9 Ore are good numbers. This move directly contributes to my goal of gaining more VP by enabling future settlements.\n\nBuilding a road towards node 14 (Action 1) is also an option for a future settlement, but the resources (Wood 10, Sheep 6, Desert) are not as good as node 22's resources.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to build a road connecting nodes 22 and 23.\n", "notes": "Build a road towards node 22 to access a strong settlement location with Wheat (4), Ore (9), and Wheat (3) to address my Wheat shortage and boost production.", "response": "Build a road towards node 22 to access a strong settlement location with Wheat (4), Ore (9), and Wheat (3) to address my Wheat shortage and boost production.\n3", "actions": "=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n0: End turn\n1: Build road connecting nodes 13 \u2194 14\n2: Build road connecting nodes 3 \u2194 4\n3: Build road connecting nodes 22 \u2194 23\n4: Build road connecting nodes 11 \u2194 12\n5: Build road connecting nodes 8 \u2194 9\n6: Build road connecting nodes 1 \u2194 6", "game_state": "=== CATAN GAME STATE ===\nTurn: 62\nCurrent player: RED\n\n=== PLAYER STATUS ===\n>>> RED: 3 VP, 8 resources (Wood: 1, Brick: 2, Sheep: 3, Wheat: 0, Ore: 2), 0 dev cards\n    BLUE: 7 VP, 8 resources, 0 dev cards\n\n=== BOARD LAYOUT ===\nRobber position: (-1, 1, 0)\n\n--- HEXAGON TILES ---\nTile 3: WOOD with number 10\nTile 4: DESERT (no resources)\nTile 2: SHEEP with number 6\nTile 0: ORE with number 9\nTile 5: WHEAT with number 3\nTile 1: BRICK with number 5\nTile 6: WHEAT with number 4\n\n--- PORTS ---\n\n--- ROADS (Edge Connections) ---\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 1\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 5\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 20\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 1 \u2194 2\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 2 \u2194 3\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 2 \u2194 9\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 3 \u2194 12\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 4 \u2194 5\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 4 \u2194 15\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 6 \u2194 7\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 6 \u2194 23\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 7 \u2194 8\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 9 \u2194 10\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 10 \u2194 11\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 12 \u2194 13\n\n--- POSSIBLE BUILDING LOCATIONS ---\nAvailable nodes for settlements: 16 nodes\nEmpty nodes: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23]\nAvailable road connections: 27 possible roads\n\n=== BUILDINGS SUMMARY ===\nRED: 3 settlements at nodes [3, 7, 13], 0 cities, 16 roads\nBLUE: 3 settlements at nodes [20, 5, 11], 2 cities at nodes [1, 9], 14 roads\n\n\nPrevious moves: Prioritize high-probability resource production (6, 8, 5, 9, 10) and resource diversity for early game development.

Assuming no_think:\nI am currently at 3 VP, while BLUE is at 9 VP. This is a critical situation, and I need to gain VPs quickly. My current resources are 1 Brick, 5 Sheep, 2 Ore. I have no Wood or Wheat.\n\nMy primary goal is to build settlements or cities to gain VPs. A settlement costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat. A city costs 3 Ore, 2 Wheat. I don't have enough resources for either.\n\nI have 5 Sheep, which allows me to perform a 4:1 maritime trade. I need Wood and Wheat to build a settlement.\n\nLet's analyze the trade options:\n1. Give 4 Sheep for 1 Brick: I already have 1 Brick. This trade would give me 2 Brick, but I still lack Wood and Wheat. This doesn't directly help me build a settlement.\n2. Give 4 Sheep for 1 Wood: This trade would give me 1 Wood. I would then have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat. I would still need Wheat.\n3. Give 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat: This trade would give me 1 Wheat. I would then have 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat. I would still need Wood.\n4. Give 4 Sheep for 1 Ore: I already have 2 Ore. This trade would give me 3 Ore. This would put me closer to building a city (3 Ore, 2 Wheat needed), but I still need 2 Wheat.\n\nConsidering my desperate need for VPs, I need to prioritize getting the resources for a settlement. I have 5 Sheep, so I can make one trade. If I trade for Wood, I'll have Wood, Brick, and Sheep, but still no Wheat. If I trade for Wheat, I'll have Wheat, Brick, and Sheep, but still no Wood.\n\nNeither trade directly gives me a settlement. However, getting one of the missing resources is better than doing nothing.\n\nLet's consider the long-term strategy. My current production is weak, especially in Wood and Wheat. I need to get a settlement down to increase my resource production.\n\nIf I trade for Wood (Action 2), I will have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore. I would then need to find a way to get Wheat.\nIf I trade for Wheat (Action 3), I will have 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore. I would then need to find a way to get Wood.\n\nGiven that I have 2 Ore, getting 1 Wheat might be slightly better if I can then trade the Ore for Wood later, or if I roll a Wheat. However, I don't have a 3:1 port, so trading Ore for Wood would be a 4:1 trade, which is inefficient.\n\nThe most immediate need is to get a settlement. I have 5 Sheep, so I can make one trade. I need both Wood and Wheat. Since I can only make one trade, I will still be missing one resource.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I have 5 Sheep. I can trade 4 Sheep for 1 of any resource.\nIf I trade for Wood, I'll have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore.\nIf I trade for Wheat, I'll have 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore.\n\nNeither of these immediately gets me a settlement. However, I need to make a move.\nI have 2 Ore. If I trade for Wheat, I'll have 1 Wheat. I'll still need Wood.\nIf I trade for Wood, I'll have 1 Wood. I'll still need Wheat.\n\nGiven my current resources, I have 2 Ore. If I trade for Wheat, I'll have 1 Wheat and 2 Ore. If I then roll a Wood, I can build a settlement. If I roll an Ore, I can save it for a city.\n\nIf I trade for Wood, I'll have 1 Wood and 2 Ore. If I then roll a Wheat, I can build a settlement.\n\nIt's a toss-up between Wood and Wheat. However, I have 2 Ore, which is a valuable resource for cities. I also have 1 Brick and 1 Sheep. My biggest deficiency is Wood and Wheat.\n\nLet's consider the probability of rolling the missing resource. I don't have any information on the dice rolls.\n\nSince I have 2 Ore, and a city costs 3 Ore and 2 Wheat, getting 1 Wheat now would put me at 1 Wheat and 2 Ore. If I can get another Wheat and 1 more Ore, I can build a city. This seems like a longer shot than a settlement.\n\nA settlement is 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat. I have 1 Brick, 1 Sheep. I need Wood and Wheat.\nIf I trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wood (Action 2), I will have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore. I will then need 1 Wheat.\nIf I trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat (Action 3), I will have 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore. I will then need 1 Wood.\n\nGiven that I have 2 Ore, and Ore is a high-value resource, I should try to get the other resources for a settlement.\nI have 5 Sheep. I can trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wood. This leaves me with 1 Sheep.\nThen I would have: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore. I would still need 1 Wheat.\n\nIf I trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat, I would have 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore. I would still need 1 Wood.\n\nIt's a difficult choice. I need to get a VP.\nLet's look at the board. My settlements are at 3 (Ore 9, Sheep 6, Wood 10), 7 (Brick 5, Ore 9, Wheat 4), 13 (Wood 10, Ore 9, Sheep 6).\nMy production is good for Ore, Sheep, and Wood. My Wheat and Brick production is weaker.\nI have 1 Brick, 5 Sheep, 2 Ore. I have no Wood or Wheat.\n\nSince my production for Wood and Wheat is weaker, I should try to get one of those resources.\nI have 5 Sheep, so I can trade 4:1.\nIf I trade for Wood, I'll have 1 Wood. I'll still need Wheat.\nIf I trade for Wheat, I'll have 1 Wheat. I'll still need Wood.\n\nI have 2 Ore. Ore is a valuable resource. I should try to hold onto it if possible for a city.\nTherefore, I should trade for either Wood or Wheat.\n\nLet's consider what I'm more likely to get from a roll. My settlements produce:\nNode 3: Ore (9), Sheep (6), Wood (10)\nNode 7: Brick (5), Ore (9), Wheat (4)\nNode 13: Wood (10), Ore (9), Sheep (6)\n\nMy production numbers are 4, 5, 6, 9, 10.\nI have good chances of getting Ore, Sheep, Wood, and some Brick and Wheat.\nI have 2 settlements on 9 (Ore), 2 on 10 (Wood), 2 on 6 (Sheep), 1 on 5 (Brick), 1 on 4 (Wheat).\nMy Wheat production is the weakest.\n\nTherefore, it makes more sense to trade for Wood (Action 2), as I have a better chance of rolling Wheat than Wood. If I trade for Wood, I'll have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep. I'll then need 1 Wheat. My settlement at node 7 produces Wheat on a 4. This is a decent chance.\n\nIf I trade for Wheat (Action 3), I'll have 1 Wheat, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep. I'll then need 1 Wood. My settlements at nodes 3 and 13 produce Wood on a 10. This is also a decent chance.\n\nIt's a close call. However, I have 2 Ore. If I trade for Wood, I'll have 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore.\nIf I trade for Wheat, I'll have 0 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore.\n\nGiven that I have two settlements on Wood 10, and only one on Wheat 4, it might be slightly more likely to roll a Wood than a Wheat. Therefore, trading for Wheat might be the better option, as I'm less likely to roll it.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. My production for Wood is 10 (two settlements). My production for Wheat is 4 (one settlement).\nThis means I am more likely to get Wood than Wheat from a roll.\nTherefore, I should trade for Wheat, as it's the resource I'm less likely to get from a roll.\n\nTrade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat. This will leave me with 1 Sheep, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore. I will then need 1 Wood to build a settlement. I have two settlements on Wood 10, so I have a good chance of rolling a 10.\n", "notes": "Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat to get closer to building a settlement, as Wheat is my weakest production.", "response": "Trade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat to get closer to building a settlement, as Wheat is my weakest production.\n3", "actions": "=== AVAILABLE ACTIONS ===\n0: End turn\n1: Maritime trade: give 4 SHEEP for 1 BRICK (4:1 port trade)\n2: Maritime trade: give 4 SHEEP for 1 WOOD (4:1 port trade)\n3: Maritime trade: give 4 SHEEP for 1 WHEAT (4:1 port trade)\n4: Maritime trade: give 4 SHEEP for 1 ORE (4:1 port trade)", "game_state": "=== CATAN GAME STATE ===\nTurn: 66\nCurrent player: RED\n\n=== PLAYER STATUS ===\n>>> RED: 3 VP, 8 resources (Wood: 0, Brick: 1, Sheep: 5, Wheat: 0, Ore: 2), 0 dev cards\n    BLUE: 9 VP, 7 resources, 0 dev cards\n\n=== BOARD LAYOUT ===\nRobber position: (-1, 1, 0)\n\n--- HEXAGON TILES ---\nTile 3: WOOD with number 10\nTile 4: DESERT (no resources)\nTile 2: SHEEP with number 6\nTile 0: ORE with number 9\nTile 5: WHEAT with number 3\nTile 1: BRICK with number 5\nTile 6: WHEAT with number 4\n\n--- PORTS ---\n\n--- ROADS (Edge Connections) ---\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 1\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 5\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 0 \u2194 20\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 1 \u2194 2\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 2 \u2194 3\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 2 \u2194 9\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 3 \u2194 12\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 4 \u2194 5\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 4 \u2194 15\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 6 \u2194 7\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 6 \u2194 23\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 7 \u2194 8\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 9 \u2194 10\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 10 \u2194 11\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 12 \u2194 13\nRoad: BLUE connecting nodes 15 \u2194 17\nRoad: RED connecting nodes 22 \u2194 23\n\n--- POSSIBLE BUILDING LOCATIONS ---\nAvailable nodes for settlements: 16 nodes\nEmpty nodes: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23]\nAvailable road connections: 25 possible roads\n\n=== BUILDINGS SUMMARY ===\nRED: 3 settlements at nodes [3, 7, 13], 0 cities, 18 roads\nBLUE: 3 settlements at nodes [20, 5, 11], 2 cities at nodes [1, 9], 16 roads\n\n\nPrevious moves: Prioritize high-probability resource production (6, 8, 5, 9, 10) and resource diversity for early game development.

While the resource diversity isn't ideal, getting a VP is crucial.\nMove robber to Wheat 4 (Action 5) to block BLUE's strong Wheat production and attempt to steal a much-needed Wheat resource.\nTrade 4 Brick for 1 Wood to get a crucial resource for future settlements and roads.\nBuild a road to expand my network towards a strong settlement location (Node 2) with high-probability resource production (Ore 9, Sheep 6, Brick 5).\nBuild a road towards node 6 to access a strong settlement location with Wheat (4), Ore (9), and Brick (5) to address my Wheat shortage and boost production.\nBuild a road towards node 23 to access a strong settlement location with Wheat (4), Ore (9), and Brick (5) to address my Wheat shortage and boost production.\nBuild a road towards node 22 to access a strong settlement location with Wheat (4), Ore (9), and Wheat (3) to address my Wheat shortage and boost production.\nTrade 4 Sheep for 1 Wheat to get closer to building a settlement, as Wheat is my weakest production.", "board_image_path": "logs/gemini-no_think-basic/boards/180.png"}]
